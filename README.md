Actually, the driver of FolderCrypt_Mini is a variant version of the minifilter of ETEFS_Mini. The focus of ETEFS_Mini is to encrypt the file generated by selected application, but FolderCrypt is focus on the encryption of the target directory which sensitive file located in. All file created in the target directory will be encrypted in real time. The encrypted files located in the target directory will be auto decrypted while file are being access. FolderCrypt also implement the access control feature. You can set access privilege for a process, user name or group name. So, FolderCrypt supports set filter like "user", "process" to permit access to an encrypted resource.
